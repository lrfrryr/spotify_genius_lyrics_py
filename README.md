## General overview
This command line app uses Spotipy (a lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API) and the Genius API to fetch the name of the song and artist that is currently playing on Spotify and search for the lyrics of said song to display them on the command line, each time a new song starts playing. It also shows some stats of the lyrics and a bit of sentiment analysis.
